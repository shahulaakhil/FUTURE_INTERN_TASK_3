# FUTURE_INTERN_TASK_3
##  Project Overview
This project was completed as part of my internship learning journey.  
It demonstrates an end-to-end Machine Learning workflow implemented using Python in Jupyter Notebook.

The main objective of this task was to:
- Load and understand the dataset
- Perform data preprocessing & cleaning
- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Build and train a Machine Learning model
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics

##  Tech Stack
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- 
##  Workflow
1. Data Collection & Loading  
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
3. Feature Analysis  
4. Model Training  
5. Model Evaluation  
6. Result Interpretation  

 ## Outcome
Successfully implemented a complete ML pipeline and validated the model’s performance.  
This project strengthened my understanding of real-world ML workflows and analytical problem-solving.
